# Cart Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update CartItem interface in store to include size and color fields
- [x] Update fetchCart function in store to map size and color from backend response
- [x] Update CartItemProps in CartItem component to include size and color
- [x] Update CartItem component to display size and color

## Summary
The cart system now properly imports and displays image, size, and color details from the database. The backend was already fetching this data via database joins, but the frontend components were not displaying the size and color information. All changes have been implemented successfully.

## Next Steps
- Test the cart page to ensure size and color are properly displayed
- Verify that the cart works correctly with different product variants
